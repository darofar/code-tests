Some code tests I have done from time to time. All of them in python. 

* [DoHashMe](dohashme/README.md): Make a dehash function to decrypt some message.
* [ObscuringCSV](obscuringcsv/README.md): Obscure sensible info from a given CSV. 
* [PalindromicNumbers](palindromic_number/README.md): Find largest palindromic number as a result of multiplying two 3-digit numbers. 
* [SudokuSpiral](spiral_sudoku/README.md): Calculate diagonal sum from a square of 1001 numbers.
