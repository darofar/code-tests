Some code tests I have done from time to time. All of them in python.

* [ObscuringCSV](obscuringcsv/): Obscure sensible info from a given CSV. 
* [PalindromicNumbers](palindromic_number/): Find largest palindromic number as a result of multiplying two 3-digit numbers. 
* [SudokuSpiral](spiral_sudoku/): Calculate diagonal sum from a square of 1001 numbers.
